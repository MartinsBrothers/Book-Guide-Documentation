Professional Risk Management Policy
n Core Objective
This framework is designed for capital preservation first, growth second. Every decision — position sizing, trade
frequency, drawdown limits — is aligned with institutional practices (hedge funds, prop firms, and global
investment standards).
1. Position Sizing (Dynamic Lots)
1 Risk-based position sizing (AutoLot): each trade risks a fixed percentage of account equity (e.g., 0.25%).
2 Lots are adjusted automatically based on stop-loss distance and broker contract size.
3 Broker constraints respected (min/max lot, step size).
2. Risk Aggregation
1 Total open risk capped at 1% of equity.
2 Maximum 3 simultaneous trades to prevent correlation blow-up.
3. Loss Controls (Institutional Guardrails)
1 Daily loss limit: halt trading after 1% drawdown.
2 Weekly loss limit: halt trading after 2% drawdown.
4. Trade Execution Filters
1 Stop-loss mandatory for every trade.
2 Slippage protection with tolerance (e.g., 3 pips).
3 News filter optional: block trades during high-impact events.
5. Performance Metrics (Professional Benchmarking)
1 Target return: 3–5% per month.
2 Maximum drawdown: ≤5% monthly.
3 Sharpe ratio baseline > 1.0, target > 1.5.
6. State-of-the-Art Enhancements
1 Equity-based risk management (not balance-based).
2 Dynamic halt system after daily/weekly loss.
3 Scalable for any account size.
4 Modular structure: compatible with different trading strategies.
7. Professional Mindset
A good money manager behaves like an insurance company: collect small, consistent gains while strictly limiting
downside. This system enforces institutional discipline: measured entries, controlled exposure, enforced
cooling-off periods, and account longevity prioritized above short-term gains.
